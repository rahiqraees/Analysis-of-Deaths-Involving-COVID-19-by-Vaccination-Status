# Analysis of Deaths Involving COVID-19 by Vaccination Status

This project presents a **comprehensive statistical analysis of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status** using R. The goal is to understand mortality patterns across demographic groups and vaccination categories, leveraging regression models and data visualization to uncover key insights. The entire workflow is documented in an **R Markdown report** for reproducibility.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Examined **COVID-19 death rates** stratified by vaccination status  
- Investigated how mortality patterns vary across **age groups and time periods**  
- Applied **statistical modeling** to evaluate associations between vaccination and outcomes  
- Communicated findings in a reproducible **R Markdown report**  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and prepared raw health datasets for analysis  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Produced descriptive summaries and trend analyses  
- **Statistical Modeling**: Implemented regression models to quantify differences in death rates  
- **Visualization**: Created comparative charts and figures to highlight trends  
- **Reproducible Workflow**: End-to-end pipeline written in R Markdown  

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- R  
- RMarkdown  
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `stats`
