# Analysis of Deaths Involving COVID-19 by Vaccination Status

This project presents a **statistical analysis of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status** using R. The study leverages publicly available health data to examine differences in mortality outcomes, applying regression models and visualization techniques to highlight patterns across demographic and vaccination groups.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Conducted a detailed analysis of **COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status**  
- Explored trends across **age groups, vaccination categories, and time periods**  
- Applied statistical modeling in R to evaluate associations  
- Documented methodology and results in an **R Markdown report**  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**: Prepared raw datasets for analysis  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visualizations of COVID-19 deaths  
- **Statistical Modeling**: Regression analysis to evaluate vaccination status as a predictor of mortality  
- **Visualization**: Line plots, bar charts, and comparative visuals to communicate findings  
- **Reproducible Report**: Analysis written in R Markdown for full transparency and reproducibility  

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- R  
- RMarkdown  
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `stats`
